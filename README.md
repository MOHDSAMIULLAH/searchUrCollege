• Access a comprehensive course directory with descriptions, durations, fees, and associated colleges.</br>
• Explore categorized courses and subcourses for focused educational choices.</br>
• Stay informed about entrance exams, their associations with courses, and essential exam-related updates.</br>
• User-Centric Approach:</br>

• Prioritize user experience through intuitive search functionality and engaging features like reviews and ratings.</br>
• Provide educational resources and career guidance to support students in making informed decisions.</br>
• Foster community engagement by enabling user reviews and discussions.</br>
#### Technology Stack and Scalability:</br>

• Utilize a technology stack comprising Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and possibly React.js (MERN Stack).</br>
• Design the platform with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth and user demands.</br>
